### Update
I've decided to put this project to sleep. What started as a hobby beginner project has reached a stage where I feel comfortable to wrap up. There are certainly many things to improve on this application, but for now PassVault shall be what it is, a simple straightforward password manager.

## Info
Electron based cross-platform desktop application for managing passwords

Store and manage your passwords on your local machine. This desktop application solves the problem of forgotten passwords and helps with your heedless behaviour of same-password-for-all-sites.  

With the help of this application you can confidently set unique and complex passwords and hand over the burden of remembering them to PassVault, you just have to remember a global-password. The passwords are encrypted and stored in your machine, making it super safe.
